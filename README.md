# Sentiment-Classifier
This is a sentiment analysis program trained using synthetic Twitter data that generates a CSV file for result visualization, and acquiring skills applicable to real Twitter data analysis.

I have developed a program in multiple steps to perform sentiment analysis, a widely utilized tool in various industries. Specifically, I have worked with synthetic Twitter data for this project. The end goal is to create a CSV file and utilize it to generate a graph that effectively visualizes the results. This graphical representation serves as a useful means to share the outcomes of the program with others. Additionally, the skills acquired in this project can be extended to create similar programs for analyzing real Twitter data.
