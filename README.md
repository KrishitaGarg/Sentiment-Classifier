# Sentiment-Classifier
This is a sentiment analysis program trained using synthetic Twitter data that generates a CSV file for result visualization, and acquiring skills applicable to real Twitter data analysis. This is taught in Coursera Python 3 Programming Specialization by University of Michigan, Course 2  which is Python Functions, Files and Dictionaries.

I have developed a program in multiple steps to perform sentiment analysis, a widely utilized tool in various industries. Specifically, I have worked with synthetic Twitter data for this project. The end goal is to create a CSV file and utilize it to generate a graph that effectively visualizes the results. This graphical representation serves as a useful means to share the outcomes of the program with others. Additionally, the skills acquired in this project can be extended to create similar programs for analyzing real Twitter data.

Thanks to Coursera for teaching how to make this project and the following for their datasets of positive and negative words:
